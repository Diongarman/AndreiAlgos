//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

dion: BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 

dion: DFS
andreas: BFS (DFS will take long because solutions are rare)


//If the tree is very wide:

Dion: BFS
Adreas: DFS (BFS needs too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

Dion: DFS



//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:

Dion: DFS


//Finding the shortest path:

Dion: BFS
